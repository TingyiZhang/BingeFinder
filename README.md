## Some thoughts
### What we found interesting?
- It's amazing that we can get all those data through Twitter API and analyze it through Google.
- These two APIs are pretty easy to use and easy to customize.
- **Twitter API does not play very nice** - Stringent API hit limit, Google API is relatively easy to use


### Things we can improve
- **Improve the scoring mechanism** - Improve how we calculate our scores, currently very basic arithmetic.
- **Filter tweets** - Improve the sentiment analysis by removing irrelevant tweets from our input to the sentiment analyzer.
- **Extend it to movies** - In the future we can try to rank the movies too.
- **Add Feature to search by genre** - Search top content by comedy, horror, thriller, etc. 

### Things we will avoid
- **Studying the API more carefully before getting started** - We ran into many API limits for Twitter
- **IMDB API does not play nice** - We tried to get TV shows list through IMDb API at first, but the IMDb API does not support searching by popularity.
